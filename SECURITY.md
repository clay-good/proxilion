## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Proxilion team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@proxilion.dev**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. **Confirm the problem** and determine the affected versions
2. **Audit code** to find any similar problems
3. **Prepare fixes** for all supported releases
4. **Release patches** as soon as possible

We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- Provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- Release a fix within 30 days for critical issues

### Security Update Process

1. Security patches are released as soon as they are available
2. We will publish a security advisory on GitHub
3. We will credit the reporter (unless they wish to remain anonymous)
4. We will notify users via:
   - GitHub Security Advisories
   - Release notes
   - Email to registered users (if applicable)

## Security Best Practices

When deploying Proxilion, we recommend:

### 1. Network Security

- Deploy behind a firewall
- Use TLS/SSL for all connections
- Implement network segmentation
- Use VPN for remote access
- Enable DDoS protection

### 2. Access Control

- Use strong authentication (OAuth, SAML, OIDC)
- Implement least privilege access
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use short-lived tokens

### 3. Configuration

- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Enable audit logging
- Set appropriate rate limits
- Configure CORS properly

### 4. Monitoring

- Enable real-time monitoring
- Set up security alerts
- Review audit logs regularly
- Monitor for anomalies
- Track failed authentication attempts

### 5. Updates

- Keep Proxilion updated to the latest version
- Subscribe to security advisories
- Test updates in staging before production
- Have a rollback plan

### 6. Data Protection

- Enable PII masking in logs
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Implement data retention policies
- Regular security audits
- Backup critical data

## Security Features

Proxilion includes built-in security features:

### Threat Detection
- PII detection and redaction
- Prompt injection prevention
- Toxicity and harm detection
- Data loss prevention (DLP)
- Compliance validation

### Access Control
- API key authentication
- JWT token validation
- OAuth/OIDC integration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Tenant isolation

### Audit & Compliance
- Complete audit trail
- Structured logging
- Compliance reporting (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOC 2)
- Security event forwarding to SIEM
- Anomaly detection

### Infrastructure Security
- Rate limiting
- Circuit breakers
- Request validation
- Input sanitization
- Output encoding

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. Secrets Management

Proxilion requires API keys for AI providers. These should be:
- Stored in secure secret management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Never committed to version control
- Rotated regularly
- Scoped with minimum required permissions

### 2. PII Handling

While Proxilion detects and masks PII:
- Some PII may still pass through before detection
- Configure appropriate retention policies
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
- Implement additional encryption for sensitive data

### 3. AI Provider Security

Proxilion proxies requests to AI providers:
- Ensure AI provider accounts are secure
- Monitor for unusual usage patterns
- Set budget limits to prevent abuse
- Review AI provider security policies

### 4. Deployment Security

When deploying Proxilion:
- Use secure deployment platforms (Cloudflare Workers, AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Enable platform-specific security features
- Implement network isolation
- Use managed services for databases and caching

## Security Audits

Proxilion undergoes regular security reviews:

- **Code Reviews**: All code changes are reviewed
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Static Analysis**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint security rules
- **Dynamic Testing**: 739 comprehensive tests including security scenarios
- **Penetration Testing**: Recommended for production deployments

## Compliance

Proxilion helps organizations comply with:

- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data security
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card data protection
- **SOC 2**: Security, availability, confidentiality
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
