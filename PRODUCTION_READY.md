## Known Limitations

1. **Workflow AI Integration**: Workflow orchestration uses mock AI responses for testing. Production integration requires connecting to the main proxy handler.

2. **GraphQL Real-time Metrics**: Metrics calculation uses approximations. For production, consider implementing a time-series database for precise metrics.

3. **Certificate Management**: Self-signed certificates work for testing. Production deployments should use certificates from a trusted CA.
