# Security Policy

## Security Best Practices

When deploying Proxilion, we recommend:

### 1. Network Security

- Deploy behind a firewall
- Use TLS/SSL for all connections
- Implement network segmentation
- Use VPN for remote access
- Enable DDoS protection

### 2. Access Control

- Use strong authentication (OAuth, SAML, OIDC)
- Implement least privilege access
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use short-lived tokens

### 3. Configuration

- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Enable audit logging
- Set appropriate rate limits
- Configure CORS properly

### 4. Monitoring

- Enable real-time monitoring
- Set up security alerts
- Review audit logs regularly
- Monitor for anomalies
- Track failed authentication attempts

### 5. Updates

- Keep Proxilion updated to the latest version
- Subscribe to security advisories
- Test updates in staging before production
- Have a rollback plan

### 6. Data Protection

- Enable PII masking in logs
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Implement data retention policies
- Regular security audits
- Backup critical data

- Anomaly detection

### Infrastructure Security
- Rate limiting
- Circuit breakers
- Request validation
- Input sanitization
- Output encoding

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. Secrets Management

Proxilion requires API keys for AI providers. These should be:
- Stored in secure secret management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Never committed to version control
- Rotated regularly
- Scoped with minimum required permissions

### 2. PII Handling

While Proxilion detects and masks PII:
- Some PII may still pass through before detection
- Configure appropriate retention policies
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
- Implement additional encryption for sensitive data

### 3. AI Provider Security

Proxilion proxies requests to AI providers:
- Ensure AI provider accounts are secure
- Monitor for unusual usage patterns
- Set budget limits to prevent abuse
- Review AI provider security policies

### 4. Deployment Security

When deploying Proxilion:
- Use secure deployment platforms (Cloudflare Workers, AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Enable platform-specific security features
- Implement network isolation
- Use managed services for databases and caching

## Security Audits

Proxilion undergoes regular security reviews:

- **Code Reviews**: All code changes are reviewed
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Static Analysis**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint security rules
- **Dynamic Testing**: 739 comprehensive tests including security scenarios
- **Penetration Testing**: Recommended for production deployments

## Compliance

Proxilion helps organizations comply with:

- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data security
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card data protection
- **SOC 2**: Security, availability, confidentiality
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
