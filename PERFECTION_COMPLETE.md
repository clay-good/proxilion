## Gaps Analysis

### Critical Gaps: NONE

All critical functionality is implemented, tested, and production-ready.

### Minor Considerations

1. **Workflow AI Integration**
   - Status: Documented approach provided
   - Impact: Low (workflows work, AI integration is optional enhancement)
   - Timeline: Can be added post-deployment

2. **GraphQL Metrics Precision**
   - Status: Approximation implemented
   - Impact: Low (metrics are directionally correct)
   - Enhancement: Time-series DB for precision (optional)

3. **Certificate Management**
   - Status: Self-signed certs for testing
   - Impact: None (production uses trusted CA)
   - Action: Standard deployment practice

**None of these affect production readiness or core functionality.**
